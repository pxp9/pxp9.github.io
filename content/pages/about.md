I'm Pepe Márquez Romero, a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building reliable systems at the intersection of embedded systems, distributed architecture, and fintech. Currently based in Estonia, I'm passionate about creating robust, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.

## What I Do

I specialize in building systems where reliability matters. At Yolo Group, I worked on payment systems that required zero-tolerance for failure, focusing on reliability engineering in a fintech environment. My technical interests span **embedded systems**, **distributed systems**, and **backend architecture** — I love working across the full stack and diving deep into complex problems.

As a **polyglot developer**, I work fluently in Elixir, Rust, Zig or any other language choosing the right tool for each challenge. I'm particularly excited about embedded systems and IoT, where hardware meets software.

## Open Source & Community

I believe in learning and building in public. I actively contribute to open-source projects, including:

- [**Nerves Hub**](https://github.com/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web/pull/2469) - Platform for firmware updates in embedded Elixir systems
- [**Name Badge**](https://github.com/protolux-electronics/name_badge) - Embedded system in Elixir
- [**sqlx**](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), [**frankenstein**](https://github.com/ayrat555/frankenstein), [**cryptopunk**](https://github.com/ayrat555/cryptopunk) - Various contributions including bug fixes, features, and documentation

I've also created tools like [lazy_doc](https://github.com/pxp9/lazy_doc) and [weather_bot](https://github.com/pxp9/weather_bot_rust/), and maintain [fang](https://github.com/ayrat555/fang) as a core contributor.

Beyond code, I share knowledge through talks and teaching. I gave [A Rust Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL6d74ISbss) to help others get started with systems programming ([talk repository](https://github.com/pxp9/acm_rust)).

## Background

**Education**: Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, School of Computer Science

**Experience Timeline**:

- **Elixir** (2021 - present): Production systems, embedded programming with Nerves
- **Rust** (2020 - present): Systems programming, open-source contributions
- **Python** (2020 - present): Scripting, automation, and backend services

I bridge the gap between academic computer science and industry practice, bringing both theoretical foundations and pragmatic problem-solving to every project.

## Looking Forward

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can work on **embedded systems**, **distributed systems**, or challenging **backend problems**. I thrive in environments that value code quality, open-source contribution, and continuous learning.

Let's build something reliable together.
