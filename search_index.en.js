Pepe Márquez Romero, a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building reliable systems at the intersection of embedded systems, distributed architecture, and fintech. Currently based in Estonia, I'm passionate about creating robust, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.\nWhat I Do\nI specialize in building systems where reliability matters. At Yolo Group, I worked on payment systems that required zero-tolerance for failure, focusing on reliability engineering in a fintech environment. My technical interests span embedded systems, distributed systems, and backend architecture — I love working across the full stack and diving deep into complex problems.\nAs a polyglot developer, I work fluently in Elixir, Rust, Zig or any other language choosing the right tool for each challenge. I'm particularly excited about embedded systems and IoT, where hardware meets software.\nOpen Source &amp; Community\nI believe in learning and building in public. I actively contribute to open-source projects, including:\nNerves Hub - Platform for firmware updates in embedded Elixir systems\nName Badge - Embedded system in Elixir\nsqlx, frankenstein, cryptopunk - Various contributions including bug fixes, features, and documentation\nI've also created tools like lazy_doc and weather_bot, and maintain fang as a core contributor.\nBeyond code, I share knowledge through talks and teaching. I gave A Rust Introduction to help others get started with systems programming (talk repository).\nBackground\nEducation: Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, School of Computer Science\nExperience Timeline:\nElixir (2021 - present): Production systems, embedded programming with Nerves\nRust (2020 - present): Systems programming, open-source contributions\nPython (2020 - present): Scripting, automation, and backend services\nI bridge the gap between academic computer science and industry practice, bringing both theoretical foundations and pragmatic problem-solving to every project.\nLooking Forward\nI'm actively seeking opportunities where I can work on embedded systems, distributed systems, or challenging backend problems. I thrive in environments that value code quality, open-source contribution, and continuous learning.\nLet's build something reliable together.","id":"https://pmarquez.net/about/","title":"About"},"https://pmarquez.net/archive/":{"body":"","id":"https://pmarquez.net/archive/","title":"Archive"},"https://pmarquez.net/async-processing/":{"body":"Even though the first stable version of Rust was released in 2015, there are still some holes in its ecosystem for solving common tasks. One of which is background processing.\nIn software engineering background processing is a common approach for solving several problems:\nCarry out periodic tasks. For example, deliver notifications, update cached values.\nDefer expensive work so your application stays responsive while performing calculations in the background\nMost programming languages have go-to background processing frameworks/libraries. For example:\nRuby - sidekiq. It uses Redis as a job queue.\nPython - dramatiq. It uses RabbitMQ as a job queue.\nElixir - oban. It uses a Postgres DB as a job queue.\nThe async programming (async/await) can be used for background processing but it has several major disadvantages if used directly:\nIt doesn't give control of the number of tasks that are being executed at any given time. So a lot of spawned tasks can overload a thread/threads that they're started on.\nIt doesn't provide any monitoring which can be useful to investigate your system and find bottlenecks\nTasks are not persistent. So all enqueued tasks are lost on every application restart\nTo solve these shortcomings of the async programming we implemented the async processing in the fang library.\nThreaded Fang\nFang is a background processing library for rust. The first version of Fang was released exactly one year ago. Its key features were:\nEach worker is started in a separate thread\nA Postgres table is used as the task queue\nThis implementation was written for a specific use case - el monitorro bot. This specific implementation of background processing was proved by time. Each day it processes more and more feeds every minute (the current number is more than 3000). Some users host the bot on their infrastructure.\nYou can find out more about the threaded processing in fang in this blog post.\nAsync Fang\nAsync provides significantly reduced CPU and memory overhead, especially for workloads with a large amount of IO-bound tasks, such as servers and databases. All else equal, you can have orders of magnitude more tasks than OS threads, because an async runtime uses a small amount of (expensive) threads to handle a large amount of (cheap) tasks\nFrom the Rust's Async book\nFor some lightweight background tasks, it's cheaper to run them on the same thread using async instead of starting one thread per worker. That's why we implemented this kind of processing in fang. Its key features:\nEach worker is started as a tokio task\nIf any worker fails during task execution, it's restarted\nTasks are saved to a Postgres database. Instead of diesel, tokio-postgres is used to interact with a db. The threaded processing uses the diesel ORM which blocks the thread.\nThe implementation is based on traits so it's easy to implement additional backends (redis, in-memory) to store tasks.\nUsage\nThe usage is straightforward:\nDefine a serializable task by adding serde derives to a task struct.\nImplement AsyncRunnable runnable trait for fang to be able to run it.\nStart workers.\nEnqueue tasks.\nLet's go over each step.\nDefine a job\nFang re-exports serde so it's not required to add it to the Cargo.toml file\nImplement the AsyncRunnable trait\nFang uses the typetag library to serialize trait objects and save them to the queue.\nThe async-trait is used for implementing async traits\nInit queue\nStart workers\nInsert tasks\nPitfalls\nThe async processing is suitable for lightweight tasks. But for heavier tasks it's advised to use one of the following approaches:\nstart a separate tokio runtime to run fang workers\nuse the threaded processing feature implemented in fang instead of the async processing\nFuture directions\nThere are a couple of features planned for fang:\nRetries with different backoff modes\nAdditional backends (in-memory, redis)\nGraceful shutdown for async workers (for the threaded processing this feature is implemented)\nCron jobs\nConclusion\nThe project is available on GitHub\nThe async feature and this post is written in collaboration between Ayrat Badykov (github) and Pepe Márquez Romero (github)","id":"https://pmarquez.net/async-processing/","title":"Fang, async background processing for Rust."},"https://pmarquez.net/fibonacci-calculation/":{"body":"Idea\nThe idea of this article is to explore the Fibonacci sequence algorithms in\nElixir, explore optimizations which can be done and explore how native code can\nhelp us in order to compute even faster. The main objective of the article is to\ncompute the largest Fibonacci number as fast as possible.\nStart with the Math !\nMost powerful algorithms out there rely on a quite simple math principle.\n$$ Fn = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $$\nThis principle means that if you know the 2 previous terms of the series you can\ncompute the next one. So the Fibonacci series is recursive because in the\ndefinition of the series appears the series itself.\nMath is not real life.\nBased on the math we have seen before we can think this algorithm:\nLet me tell you why this is a terrible idea. This algorithm is super slow,\nbecause it does extra computations which are already computed and it does not store\nany result.\nAs you can see from this example, the complexity of this algorithm grows exponentially $O(2^n)$.\nNotice that we are doing multiple times the same computation $F_{n-2}$ or $F_{n-3}$.\nImproving naive solution.\nOne improvement we can do to the solution is to apply Dynamic\nprogramming. We can optimize\nthe algorithm by doing memoization, so the complexity can be reduced a lot.\nThis is the same algorithm as before, but we cache the results in an ETS\ntable, so if we have an already\ncomputed result, we do not need to recompute it all.\nWe can do a simple benchmark between this implementation with memoization and\nthe other one with not, so it demonstrates how powerful is this technique.\nFor each input we flush the memoization cache, because it will be unfair if we\nleave it, since it will not compute every N at least once.\nSometimes improving is not enough.\nDynamic programming implementation is pretty fast, but it is not enough. We can\nget a better implementation if we rethink the naive approach to make it\n$O(n)$.\nOne trick we can do is to store the previous 2 numbers as parameters of the recursion so this way, we dont need to compute all the other results each time.\nThis implementation still uses the same mathematical principle, but it does less iterations, and it uses way more less storage since it just needs to store the 2 previous fibonacci numbers.\nWhat about another math approach ?\nThere is another mathematical formula called Binet's formula.\n$$ Fn = \\frac{\\phi^{n} - (-\\phi^{-n})} {\\sqrt{5}} $$\nThis principle allow us to calculate any number of the sequence by just knowing\nthe value of $\\phi$ constant.\nThis implementation is in fact $O(1)$ or $O(log n)$, depends on the complexity of :math.pow function. What is the tradeoff ? This implementation is an approximation so you will be stacking error. Notice that one divided the square root of 5 is calculated with the quake 3 algorithm, another alternative would be to hardcode this constant in the algorithm.\nThe end ?\nSo... Is this the end ?\nNO, because you should know that Elixir runs in the Erlang VM which probably has some overhead\nwhile calculating. We can try to make an Erlang NIF (Native Implementation Function), to see if it is faster than just standard Elixir.\nTo do so, we can take a look to rustler, which is fantastic crate/elixir library.\nThis is the code we will be using in Rust,\nand for the $\\phi$ based algorithm,\nOf course the phi_formula implementation has the same issue as the elixir one since it is an approximation, it should not be super precise at large scale.\nLets talk about the Rust implementation of Fibonacci, as you can see is $O(N)$ and notice we are just using 2 variables instead of 3, this is because an arithmetic operation should be faster than storing in a CPU register. Also notice that Rust forces us to put types and,\nwe are using u128, so this way we can compute and store really big integer.\nWait something weird is happening\nWhen I was testing the code for this article, I realized that sometimes Rust implementation was not consistant with the Elixir one, especially at large scale.\nIt seems everything is correct, for 100, but things are getting weird for 200.\nWhat the hell the same algorithm gives different result ?\nThe answer is called overflow. Since Rust is working with limited size integers it overflows for big numbers.\nWhy Elixir does not have this problem ? It is because Elixir integers are dynamically sized. It creates a little bit of overhead because you must do allocations to fit the integer, but it allows you to have an \"infinite\" integer. I recommend this read Learning Elixir: Understanding Numbers, in order to have a better understanding of what Elixir is doing.\nThen I wondered, What if I can make the same Elixir behaviour in Rust ?\nThankfully, there are already super smart people in the Rust ecosystem that thought about\nthis problem, and I observed that there was already a crate for this num_bigint.\nAnother thing, one of the guys who did rustler, thought about this problem and\nhe integrated rustler with num_bigint, so this way you can have a translation layer with these kind of integers in Rust. Take a look the Encoder impl for BigInt, this is the translation layer for Rust BigInt to Elixir term which is an integer.\nLets take a look to the implementation with BigInt\nAs you can see nothing really changes, now we are using the big integer which are resizable,\nand allow us to store massive integers.\nLets try with this implementation and see if it gives the same result as Elixir one.\nYES! It works! Now we can compute and store massive Fibonacci calculations.\nTheory pretty cool, but show me the numbers.\nOk ok, now is the moment you were waiting for! The benchmarks and see if the theory is confirmed.\nThe benchmark library I will be using is Benchee, this library allow me to compare and obtain stats for each implementation\nand different inputs.\nI would like to explain I have divided the benchmarking in 2. Relative small inputs,\nless than 100, and really big inputs from 200_000.\nThese are the specs of my system\nThis is the setup for low inputs.\nBefore you look the results you need to consider that Rust expanding nums implementation was run with the dirty scheduler in Erlang, without it is still the worst, because of the overhead it has, but not so much worse around 33x slower. Also consider invalid $\\Phi$ formula implementations for the input &gt;= 71 or input &gt;= 75, because they start to not give a precise value after that.\nAs you can see here the result for input 71 is correct for 72 is not, as well in the $\\phi$ elixir implementation.\nHere are the results for the benchmark low inputs.\nThe conclusion we can make here is that for really small inputs Rust NIF is\nworth it to use even if Elixir wins for input 1 because it is a clause in the\nfunction almost without any overhead. $\\Phi$ algorithm is not so fast for low\ninputs so it is not worth to use. Notice that Rust expandable integers\nimplementation has a super big overhead which is not compensate with the small\ninput.\nThis is the setup I was doing for Big numbers,\nAs you can see here we have much bigger inputs, other functions cannot be included in\nthis benchmark because they will lose precision, they will take too much time or\nthey will take too much memory.\nThese are the results for the big numbers benchmark.\nThis is really interesting result, since it seems Rust expanding nums it pays the overhead by winning Elixir to all the inputs except for 2 million, I believe why Elixir wins in 2 million input is because some sort of reallocation optimization which is not in Rust.\nConclusion\nFor every peak performance algorithm you should analyze your inputs and make correct assumptions like input &lt;= 71, so this way you benefit of the approximation algorithm.\nIf your inputs are super large, consider using native code, instead of working in VM code.\nIt seems to pay off the Native code, in fact Elixir is kinda cheating because Erlang is probably calling some C code to compute this kinda numbers.\nBenchmark! Always test your things with stress, load and speed benchmarking, this way you can ensure that your algorithm is gonna behave how you will expect.\nOf course there is much more strategies here which I did not cover, like Multi-threading, dividing the work in chunks and so on...\nHopefully you liked the article, all the code of the article is available in Github","id":"https://pmarquez.net/fibonacci-calculation/","title":"Fibonacci calculation at peak performance"},"https://pmarquez.net/iot-intro/":{"body":"Introduction\nIoT (Internet of Things) has become a popular term in the society, at least\nbetween software and hardware enthusiasts. A lot of people want to experiment at\nleast once in life how is controlling real world devices with Software. It is\nsuper interesting because it has many applications, cars, household appliances,\nmanufacturing industry and many more.\nIf you are reading this article, it is because you are either interested in learning embedded systems, or how\nto program your first firmware in a board in Elixir.\nBasic IoT concepts\nFor doing IoT you will need to know that you have 2 main types of processors:\nMicro processors units (MPU) devices like Raspberry Pi family, Beagle Bone or\nArduino UNO Q (Arduino UNO Q is an exceptional board because it has a MPU and\nMCU in the same board).\nMicro controllers units (MCU) devices like ESP32 family, STM32 family or\nRaspberry Pi pico family.\nPeripherals or Sensors.\nPeripherals or Sensors are external to MPUs, therefore, you will need to implement a driver\nfor this, or take one already done. Peripherals or sensors can be\ninside an MCU, but usually are outside of them, you will need a driver as well.\nMost driver implementations are taking one communication protocol as a standard\nlike I2C, SPI or UART and giving some meaning to the messages sent. If none of\nthese protocols are being used, it means that the device is controlled by raw\nsignals (also called parallel interface), and you will need to read the\ndatasheet of the peripheral.\nEvery good MPU, MCU, sensor, or peripheral has an open datasheet. I would say, do\nnot buy a peripheral if you cannot find easily its datasheet online.\nMain differences between MPU and MCU.\nPerformance, MPUs are much faster than MCUs. MPUs clock for a embedded\ndevice can run at 2.4Ghz compared to the MCUs, which can go between 800Mhz\n(STM32V8), 240 MHz (ESP32-S3) or 16 MHz (slowest Arduino).\nOS vs No OS or RTOS. Conventional operating systems do not have time\nguarantees when they take control in a system call, they are gonna return\nyou the execution control whenever the OS scheduler wants. For time constraint applications, this is really\nimportant, thats why MCUs do not use OS, or they use a\nRTOS.\nPower consumption. MCUs consume way less energy than MPUs, which makes them a\nperfect fit for field applications.\nApplications. MPUs can run AI models, Complex web applications, any kind of heavy\nprocessing tasks. MCUs can run applications which are soft processing tasks\nand real time responses, for example, controlling the servos of one mechanical\nhardware (you do not want a conventional OS to block the execution of a robot\nfor a unknown period of time).\nWhy Elixir for IoT ?\nReduce the amount of languages in your stack.\nConsider you want to do a Full system from the smallest MCU chip to Cloud.\nHow would you do it without the Elixir way?\nYou will use C , C++ or MicroPython for the MCU.\nYou will use a small Linux distribution (Alpine or Debian based like Raspian),\nwhich you will have to install, the language of your preference to code in the\nMPUs and make sure that the Linux distribution has the proper drivers for the\nhardware you want to use. Make sure that the OS starts the application you\ndid, via systemd unit.\nMake an application to run in the Cloud with any stack, Go, Python, or\nwhatever language of your preference.\nWhy is so hard ?\nIn Elixir you will use:\nAtomVM for MCUs, it ships with RTOS or not depending on the MCU chip.\nNerves for MPUs.\nElixir for making cloud applications.\nFeature rich in embedded systems which you cannot imagine or not even come close.\nFault tolerant. Your application can recover from a unexpected failures. This\nfeature is builtin in any Erlang VM application.\nDistributed computing by construction. Erlang VM concurrency model, allows\nconcurrency and distribution on any application.\nVibrant and active community.\nIf you are new experimenting with this stuff, you might have skill issues like me\nand you might want help from smarter or with more experienced people than you.\nNerves and AtomVM core maintainers and enthusiasts developers like me are active\nin the Elixir and Erlang forums. If you have a question, you can always ask in\nthose channels or in the Elixir Discord channel.\nNerves project. MPUs IoT in Elixir.\nNerves is an Elixir project for doing embedded Linux systems. What this Embedded\nLinux framework does for you ?\nPrebuilt Linux kernel builds (built with BuildRoot) for most popular boards,\nNerves provides customized kernels for each board which boots the Linux\nsystem, starts your Erlang VM and then Erlang VM starts your application. Even\nthe customized Linux kernel, setups a watchdog for tracking the Erlang VM OS\nprocess, so even if the Erlang VM crashes, the system is smart enough to\nrestart the Erlang VM.\nAbility to customize the kernel for your board, Nerves give you the ability\nfor extend the kernel that you are gonna run in the MPU, for supporting more\nhardware.\nSupport most common Communication protocols in embedded systems, I2C, SPI and\nUart (via Elixir Circuits), popular\ndevice drivers, and so on ...\nSupported Networking via Nerves\nNetworking libraries. WiFi, mDNS,\nethernet etc...\nHow to start a Nerves project ?\nYou just need to use Nerves\nbootstrap.\nonce installed, you can run this command to create an empty nerves project\nwhich will create an empty Nerves project.\nBy default, Nerves creates a project which is supported in all the boards that\nhave official support, but it will not download a specific Linux build until\nMIX_TARGET env var is set and mix deps.get is executed.\nmix.exs file.\nyou will need to specify your specific board,\nNote: it could be any of the supported targets, this is an example.\nthen you will get the precompiled Linux kernel for your board.\nonce you got all the things installed, you can start developing.\nthe development lifecycle would be something like this.\nThe reason mix burn and mix upload are different is because one will erase\nall the partitions and the existing data in the board, and the other will just\nupdate the board via SSH (it is setup by default). Another reason to keep both\ntasks splitted is because Nerves supports blue-green deployments, mix upload\nwill upload the firmware to a partition not used to boot, and it will try to\nboot in the partition where the new firmware was flashed, if the new firmware\ndoes not boot, it will rollback to the previous working firmware.\nNow you should be able to develop your own stuff, with Nerves and its ecosystem.\nAtomVM project. MCUs IoT in Elixir.\nAtomVM is an Erlang and C project which makes a different implementation of the\nErlang VM, but works with Elixir and Erlang compilers since both compile to\nBEAM standard.\nThe reason they need to implement the Erlang VM is because are more hardware\nconstrained and it cannot run Linux, apart from the Real-Time needs, these\ndevices require.\nWhat AtomVM does for you ?\nPrebuilt AtomVMs images from boards contained in the releases.\nSupported most communication protocols\ni2c,\nuart and\nspi\nSupported Networking in their standard library AtomVM\nestdlib\nlibraries. WiFi, mDNS, ethernet etc...\nCAVEATS: AtomVM is a quite new project and the devices might have partially\nsupported features, but all of the features are available in ESP32 family.\nHow to start an AtomVM project ?\nUnfortunately, at the date I am writing this article, this\nPR has not been merged which\nwill allow an automatic setup similar to Nerves bootstrap.\nTo illustrate how the setup will be, these are the steps you will need to do.\nCreate a normal mix new project\nedit your mix.exs file, it needs to have exatomvm dep and atomvm\noptions which might differ depending on your board. Here you also define an\nstarting point which is compulsory for AtomVM apps.\ndefine the start function in the given module.\nExecute mix deps.get\nSearch for a precompiled firmware for your board in the latest AtomVM\nrelease.\nPut the .avm files from the latest release in avm_deps folder (create it\nif not present).\nFlash the AtomVM itself in the board.\nCompile the AtomVM firmware.\nFlash the .avm file, the result of the compilation of your AtomVM firmware\nonce you got all the things installed, you can start developing.\nthe development lifecycle would be something like this.\nAs you can see, you just need to flash once the AtomVM itself.\nNote that each time, you want to flash, packbeam task is called, so the .avm\nis always generated just before flashing.\nESP32\nFortunately, for ESP32\nif we have the exatomvm dep installed since it will provide,\nthe mix task\nesp32.install,\nwhich will automate steps 5,6,7\nthe mix task\nesp32_flash,\nwhich will automate steps 8 and 9\nfor ESP32 the development lifecycle will look like this\nWhat kind of stuff I built with this tech ?\nThe reason I am writing this article is because I have built an LLM agent which\ncontrols, the hardware via prompts.\nThe project is open source and you can check it here,\ngithub.com/pxp9/try_nerves\nWhat this project does is the following thing:\nYou request a LLM prompt via a Telegram Bot which is running in the Nerves\nfirmware.\nThe LLMAgent implemented in the Nerves firmware, will use the sensors\navailable which are registered as a tool.\nEach peripherial/sensor will register itself when available in the LLM agent.\nAn Arduino board implements a green led blinking and a photoresistor,\nconnected by Uart to the rasberry pi 3 where the Nerves firmware is running.\nAn Raspberry pi pico 2W implements a RGB led, connected by Wifi to the\nraspberry pi 3.\nThen you can do stuff like this:\nThe prompt given to the system, and the result in the hardware.\nI hope you liked the article.\nConsider give a star to the\ngithub.com/pxp9/try_nerves repo.\nThank you for your attention.","id":"https://pmarquez.net/iot-intro/","title":"A gentle introduction to Elixir IoT"},"https://pmarquez.net/lazy-doc/":{"body":"Idea\nAll started with a conversation with my boss, I was talking to him about a game\nwe play (Balatro, wonderful game), and suddenly he asked, Are you using AI to\nprogram ? I told him that current the state of the AI is not that good for\nsuggesting production code, but it is good to suggest other things like\nexplanations, suggest syntax fixes, etc... One of the problems we have in my\ncompany codebase is that we have so much undocumented code, which is not a big\nproblem at all, because we have a really clear API of how to interact, but each\ntime someone new comes to the project, you need to explain the localized\nknowledge. We also talked about AI writing docs might be good, but we did not\neven know because we had not tested yet. That was how Lazy Doc idea came from.\nWhat is Lazy Doc ?\nLazy Doc is a tool to improve your nonexistent or missing Elixir docs via AI. It\ndetects undocumented functions, it gives the source code to the AI and it\ngenerates documentation based on it.\nYou just need to install it and configure it, execute mix lazy_doc and boom\nyou have brand new documentation from scratch.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of Lazy Doc is much bigger it aims to be a docs checker as well.\nwith mix lazy_doc.check you can check if all the documentation under\npatterns paths regex. This check can be easily implemented in the CI, so if\nyou forget to document something CI will not pass.\nDocumentation criteria\nLazy Doc will only document functions which agree with the following criteria:\nPublic functions not already documented. (already documented functions are\nignored)\nPublic functions without hidden documentation tag @doc false. (hidden docs\nfunction are ignored).\nPrivate functions are ignored (but included in the prompt if they are\nauxiliary functions continue reading for more info).\nso this way if lazy_doc.check does not pass because of a function, you take\none of the following actions.\nMake the function private\nMake the doc hidden\nDocument or just execute mix lazy_doc.\nThe main reason LazyDoc can be really good for your project, it is because it\nwill enforce you to write documentation. Even if you do not want it, it offers a\ngood start template.\nHow is it built ?\nOkay, you want to build a an automatic documentor, right ? So the first step is\nto detect what the hell you should document and what you should not and leave\nit as it is.\nWhat alternatives do you have to detect undocumented functions ?\nYou always need to read the file at least once and then you have multiple\napproaches.\nProcess line by line approach\nThis approach consist to check each line and look for search patterns, in our\ncase @doc whatever on top of a function.\nThere are a bunch of problems with this approach:\nhow do you get the code of a single function and its clauses ? you can try to\nread lines until one end , but how do you know if it is an end of a case\nor an end of the def.\nhow do you retain the format of the file ?\nhow do you detect inner inner modules ?\nhow do you detect if a function is inside an inner module or not ?\nAs you can see this is a simple approach, but it has a bunch of problems and\nprobably many more problems, which I had not thought, because I did not even try\nto implement it this way.\nSo what is the alternative ?\nASTs for the king approach\nOkay, so we are gonna try to detect functions through the AST of the module but\nfirst, let's explain what an AST is. An AST is a data structure which contains\nthe syntax of the code, in fact it stands for Abstract Syntax Tree.\nIn Elixir an AST has always the same pattern.\nSo you get the AST of file, via Code.string_to_quote() function.\nFor instance this module, it will have the corresponding AST\nNote: you can experiment with ast.ninja site if you want to\nexperiment with ASTs\nYou can just pattern match the node you want and get the code from that node.\nfor example:\nIn ast_fun we have the sub ast of that function we just need to convert it\nback to code and send it to analyze with AI, but just if it is not documented.\nAnd you know that number function is in the Example module because it was in\ntheir children nodes list.\nHow do you convert AST to String again ?\nYou can just use Macro.to_string(ast_fun). (There is some caviar on this,\ncontinue reading).\nHow do we know if a function is already documented or not ?\nEasy, you just need to call Code.fetch_docs(module) which requires to give the\nname of the module.\nNot so fast, what happens if you have the same name of function with different\nnumber of arguments (different arities not clauses). This function will return\nyou documentation for each different function in the language, but are 2\nfunctions with the same name different from each other, just because their arity\ndiffers? The answer is YES, but does this make sense in the POV of\ndocumentation. Think for a moment of what coding situation would you use the\nsame name with different arities.\nLet's take a look this example:\nProbably just because one of the functions is auxiliary of the other. So the\nauxiliary function does not make sense by itself and the entry point function\ndoes not make sense without the auxiliary. We need a way to group up the\nfunctions by name even if they have different arity and clauses (function same\nname and same arity) to send it to AI in a single prompt.\nFetch the prompt\nOkay, you need a way to get the documentation using AI\nSo what you should do is to call an AI API, but which one ?\nThere is a bunch of AI APIs and everyone has its favorite AI. Not talking about\nif you want to use an internal model of the company, it could be really hard. So\nwhy not give freedom to call your own AI ?\nYou just need to implement the LazyDoc.Provider behavior. This is the contract\nthat will use LazyDoc to request the docs to API and extract them from the\nresponse.\nMake a good prompt (AI is like a kid explain what you want).\nMaking a good prompt is really important for fetching the docs, you should\nspecify your prompt always with at least one example and be precise with the\nformat you want.\nExample:\nThis is the default prompt the library will use, to this prompt you should\nconcatenate the function code. Of course there is a bunch of attempts to get the\nright prompt and you need to even consider to be compliant with existing doc\ntools.\nInsert the docs on the AST\nTo insert the doc in the AST you just need to create a @doc node and insert it\njust before def node.\nbut what if this def node is in an inner module children. You need to find\nfirst the children of the corresponding module. JUST pattern match, it will\nwork (complex pattern match but I promise, it will work). Once you have the\nchildren, need to locate the def node position in the children and then insert\nit just one position before.\nThe end of the trip ?\nAnd then transform the AST to String with Macro.to_string() and write it to\nthe corresponding file, right ?\nWRONG, you just messed up all the format of the original file.\nWhat? Where are my comments? it just deleted my comments during the entire\nprocess.\nHow do you fix it ?\nThe master talk about AST manipulation.\nAt this point, you are almost there, almost done, but you are kind of stuck\nbecause you want to preserve the code as it was. Remember this ?\nleave the code as it is\nIt is one of the premises that we have at least to use it in production.\nSurprise surprise, you have seen it before, it is the AST NINJA talk. Actually\nthe name of the talk is The Elixir parser under microscope by Arjan Scherpenisse.\nThis talk is about how to preserve the code as it is after an AST manipulation.\nBasically what you need to do is what the Elixir Formatter does, Add tokenizer\nmetadata to AST, store the comments outside the AST and merge it after all the\nAST manipulation.\nFortunately this talk was done years ago and the Elixir std library changed\naccording the talk recommendations, so we just need to use\nCode.string_to_quote_with_comments with some options and then after the AST\nmanipulation use\nThis will preserve the format of the file.\nFeature requests\nAfter telling you how you can build LazyDoc, I can tell you what features\nrequest were requested.\nThey requested a way to not have bloated documentation files, the issue users\nfound was that generating so much docs will cause the file incresize the size\ndramatically. So in order to address it, I added the external_doc option\nwhich allows you to write the doc in a separate markdown file and read the doc\nof that function at compile time.\nExample:\npriv/lazy_doc/lazy_doc/docs_per_module.md\nlib/lazy_doc.ex\nthis way, you can enjoy a rich documentation without having big blocks of\ndocumentation before each function. Even the LSP will give you the documentation\nif you hover over the function, because the documentation is embedded in the\n.beam file.\nIn the article, we focus on the functions because they were more interesting\nto analyze how they were done, but the library can also generate @moduledoc\nbased on the code of the module, but usually a module needs a context in the\napplication in order to write their @moduledoc so the feature request is to\nmake a dependency module graph and include the dependency @moduledoc or the\ncode of dependency module in the prompt. (TO BE DONE).\nAnother interesting feature is to clean all the docs, so this way you can\nregenerate them from scratch, so we have created a third task mix lazy_doc.clean which deletes all the @doc annotations, but it keeps @doc false annotations. This is useful when your product has evolved, but your docs\nhave not evolved with your product.\nMake a default prompt to generate docs compliant with ex_docs, this way when\nwe generate the docs webpage, you can experience the documentation as it was a\nusual docs.\nConclusion\nMaking new projects make you learn a lot of stuff. Usually to share your\nprojects, you need to write how to use them properly, that is the reason\ndevelopers write docs. I do not know a bunch of people who likes writing docs or\nthey have time to write them. Writing docs maybe does not add too much business\nvalue to the product you are building but it will add a huge value to developers\nbuilding the product or the developers using your product and they are gonna be\nless prone to making mistakes.\nWriting LazyDoc, it allows me to learn about deep aspects of the Elixir core,\nElixir AST and learn what weird stuff you can do. For example\nThis is valid Elixir code, but it is not allowed in LazyDoc.\nWriting LazyDoc, I realize that good software sometimes needs to be opinionated,\ntake a strong opinion and follow it until the end, for example external_doc\nfeature is really opinionated because some people will like to have the docs in\nthe code and some other will just like to see the code and not being distracted\nbut anything else. Another strong opinion that this library takes is what does\nwith the functions of the same name, basically we understand that they are the\nsame function to document even that for Elixir it is not. At least every\nteammates I asked told me that 2 functions named the same are always related, so\nit makes sense to document them together. Same nested named modules does not\nmake sense in almost any situation, so LazyDoc does not allow it because they\nhave the same AST structure.\nThank you very much for your reading effort.\nYou can support lazy_doc repo and if you\nare curious how LazyDoc docs look, LazyDoc is documented by LazyDoc itself you\ncan check it in lazy_doc\nhexdocs","id":"https://pmarquez.net/lazy-doc/","title":"Lazy Doc, Your documentation tool has arrived."},"https://pmarquez.net/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://pmarquez.net/pages/","title":""},"https://pmarquez.net/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://pmarquez.net/projects/","title":"Projects"}},"docInfo":{"https://pmarquez.net/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://pmarquez.net/about/":{"body":231,"title":0},"https://pmarquez.net/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://pmarquez.net/async-processing/":{"body":424,"title":5},"https://pmarquez.net/fibonacci-calculation/":{"body":735,"title":4},"https://pmarquez.net/iot-intro/":{"body":919,"title":4},"https://pmarquez.net/lazy-doc/":{"body":987,"title":5},"https://pmarquez.net/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://pmarquez.net/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":9},"lang":"English"}
